=========

------
v0.0.3
------
Release date: TBD

**Highlights**
  
  * New feature: widgets 
    Widgets enable dynamic retrieval of Unit attributes, useful for creating
    things like a list of most recent posts or a list of archive links. They
    are Python functions stored in ``widgets.py`` in the project root directory.

  * New feature: logging
    Users can now log their entire Volt run and log their custom engines,
    plugins, or widgets.

  * New command: ``volt add``
    ``volt add`` creates template files for writing custom engine, plugin, or
    widget, in the root project directory.

  * Improved console messages.

  * New settings:
    - SITE.LOG_LEVEL
      Integer to set logging level, using values similar to Python's logging
      module.
    - SITE.WIDGETS
      List of widgets that do not retrieve information from engine units.
    - {ENGINE}.WIDGETS
      List of widgets that retrieve information from engine units.
    - {ENGINE}.PLUGINS
      List of plugins to run on the specified engine units.
    - SITE.EXTRA_PAGES
      List of template file names for creating pages independent from any
      engines. Useful for creating for example a main ``index.html`` file or
      a ``404.html`` file.
    - SITE.FILTERS
      List of custom Jinja2 filters.
    - SITE.TESTS
      List of custom Jinja2 tests.

**Others**

  * Changed/removed these setting names/values:
    - {ENGINE}.CONTENT_DATETIME_FORMAT -> {ENGINE}.DATETIME_FORMAT
    - SITE.PLUGINS -> removed
    - VOLT.LAYOUT_DIR -> SITE.ASSET_DIR
    - default VOLT.ASSET_DIR value is ``assets``
    - default VOLT.CONTENT_DIR value changed to ``contents`` from ``content``

  * Active engines must now define a ``units`` property method that returns all
    its units.

  * Engine.activate renamed to Engine.preprocess and is not an abstract method
    anymore.

  * Plus many other internal code refactorizations and improvements.

**Fixes**

  * ``volt serve`` now only runs ``volt gen`` once

  * All Volt commands work from anywhere inside a Volt project directory now


------  
v0.0.2
------
Release date: 2012-25-03

**Highlights**

  * Preliminary support for more python versions: 3.2 and 2.6

  * Preliminary support for rSt and textile plugins

  * Default configuration name changes:
      - ``PACKS``          -> ``PAGINATIONS``
      - ``POSTS_PER_PAGE`` -> ``UNITS_PER_PAGINATION``
      - ``SORT``           -> ``SORT_KEY``

**Others**

  * ``volt serve`` now generates the site first before serving any contents.

  * PyYAML dependency removed.

  * Pygments is now an optional dependency.

  * Engines and Plugins now store their default settings as a class attribute.
    Users can override this by creating a Config object with the designated
    name (the value of the Engine/Plugin class attribute 'USER_CONF_ENTRY')
    in the project's voltconf.py.

**Fixes**

  * Windows terminal output does not display ANSI color codes anymore.

  * Volt server regeneration now works if voltconf.py is changed.
