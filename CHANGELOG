CHANGELOG
=========


Version 0.0.3 (alpha)
---------------------
Release date: TBD

Highlights:
  
  o New builtin plugins: css_minifer and js_minifier.

  o New builtin jinja test: ``activein``, for testing whether an engine,
    plugin, or widget is active.

  o New feature: widgets 
    Widgets enable dynamic retrieval of Unit attributes, useful for creating
    things like a list of most recent posts or a list of archive links. They
    are Python functions stored in ``widgets.py`` in the project root directory.

  o New feature: logging
    Users can now log their entire Volt run and log their custom engines,
    plugins, or widgets.

  o New command: ``volt add``
    ``volt add`` creates template files for writing custom engine, plugin, or
    widget, in the root project directory.

  o Improved console messages.

  o New settings:
    - SITE.LOG_LEVEL
      Integer to set logging level, using values similar to Python's logging
      module.
    - SITE.WIDGETS
      List of widgets that do not retrieve information from engine units.
    - {ENGINE}.WIDGETS
      List of widgets that retrieve information from engine units.
    - {ENGINE}.PLUGINS
      List of plugins to run on the specified engine units.
    - SITE.PAGES
      List of template file names for creating pages independent from any
      engines. Useful for creating for example a main ``index.html`` file or
      a ``404.html`` file.
    - SITE.FILTERS
      List of custom Jinja2 filters.
    - SITE.TESTS
      List of custom Jinja2 tests.
    - SITE.SLUG_CHAR_MAP
      Dictionary of characters to replace in a slug, useful for specifying
      custom non-ascii character replacements

  o Changed/removed these setting names/values:
    - {ENGINE}.CONTENT_DATETIME_FORMAT -> {ENGINE}.DATETIME_FORMAT
    - VOLT.LAYOUT_DIR -> SITE.ASSET_DIR
    - default VOLT.ASSET_DIR value is ``assets``
    - default VOLT.CONTENT_DIR value changed to ``contents`` from ``content``

  o Active engines must now define a ``units`` property method that returns all
    its units.

  o Engine.activate renamed to Engine.preprocess and is not an abstract method
    anymore.

  o Plus many other internal code refactorizations and improvements.

Fixes:

  o ``volt serve`` now only runs ``volt gen`` once

  o All Volt commands work from anywhere inside a Volt project directory now


Version 0.0.2 (alpha)
---------------------
Release date: 2012-25-03

Highlights:

  o Preliminary support for more python Versions: 3.2 and 2.6

  o Preliminary support for rSt and textile plugins

  o Default configuration name changes:
    - ``PACKS``          -> ``PAGINATIONS``
    - ``POSTS_PER_PAGE`` -> ``UNITS_PER_PAGINATION``
    - ``SORT``           -> ``SORT_KEY``

  o ``volt serve`` now generates the site first before serving any contents.

  o PyYAML dependency removed.

  o Pygments is now an optional dependency.

  o Engines and Plugins now store their default settings as a class attribute.
    Users can override this by creating a Config object with the designated
    name (the value of the Engine/Plugin class attribute 'USER_CONF_ENTRY')
    in the project's voltconf.py.

Fixes:

  o Windows terminal output does not display ANSI color codes anymore.

  o Volt server regeneration now works if voltconf.py is changed.


Version 0.0.1 (alpha)
---------------------
Release date: 2012-06-03

Highlights: First Volt release
