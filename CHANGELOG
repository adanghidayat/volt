v0.0.2
------
Release date: 2012-25-03

Highlights:
  * Preliminary support for more python versions: 3.2 and 2.6
  * Preliminary support for rSt and textile plugins
  * ``volt serve`` now generates the site first before serving any contents.
  * PyYAML dependency removed.
  * Pygments is now an optional dependency.
  * Engines and Plugins now store their default settings as a class attribute.
    Users can override this by creating a Config object with the designated
    name (the value of the Engine/Plugin class attribute 'USER_CONF_ENTRY')
    in the project's voltconf.py.
  * Default configuration name changes:
      - PACKS          -> PAGINATIONS
      - POSTS_PER_PAGE -> UNITS_PER_PAGINATION
      - SORT           -> SORT_KEY

Fixes:
  * Windows terminal output does not display ANSI color codes anymore.
  * Volt server regeneration now works if voltconf.py is changed.


v0.0.1
------
* Release date: 2012-06-03
